/*
 * anvil.control v1: the core's private service for anvil-overlay (design §15,
 * #58). Status and start-up warnings, the settings of every plugin, the
 * previous crash report, the log tail and "disable at the next start"; since
 * 1.3 the plugins in mods with their approval (#60). Fields and functions
 * are only appended: a caller checks `size` before it reads a later one.
 *
 * Not part of the SDK: it lives in the Anvil repository, only Anvil's own
 * plugins use it, and it may change in a minor release (a new version is
 * registered next to the old one only when a released overlay needs it).
 * Every function may be called from any thread. Strings are UTF-8.
