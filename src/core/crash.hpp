namespace anvil::crash {

// Crash capture (design §12). Installed once per process at the entry point:
//
//  - A vectored handler records fatal-looking exceptions (first chance) in
//    memory: no IO, no allocation, at most 8. On a stack overflow it also
//    hands the exception to the helper thread (below), because the crashed
//    thread may have no stack left for the filter.
//  - An unhandled-exception filter ahead of EU4's: Anvil sets it before the
//    game's C runtime starts and replaces eu4.exe's import of
//    SetUnhandledExceptionFilter. The game's own calls (its C runtime, its
//    crash reporter) then only record their filter as Anvil's next one and get
//    back the one they replaced, so Anvil's filter stays on top: it has the
//    report written, then calls the game's filter and returns what that
//    returns. A filter set through another module's import is detected when
//    the game is ready (anvil-game.ready) and logged (check_filter).
//  - A helper thread, started here with its own stack, the minidump writer
//    loaded and a minidump file already open, writes every report while the
//    crashed thread waits, so a crash with little stack or a broken heap is
//    still written. After the report it adds a small minidump and names it
//    in the report.
//
// Reports go to <crash_dir>/<time>.json, .txt and .dmp; the last 10 are kept.
// While the process runs, the minidump file waits as pending-<pid>.dmp, which
// the system deletes when the process ends unless a crash kept it. Not
// caught: __fastfail and /GS failures (they bypass both handlers),
// TerminateProcess, and exceptions a frame handler of the game catches first.

// the 3.2 KB of AVX-512, but not the 11.5 KB where the host enables AMX: there
// Windows ends the process before any handler runs. The game's main thread
// gets 64 KB at install; its other threads get thread_guarantee() from
// version.dll's DllMain when they start (guard_thread).
//
// The guarantee a thread needs for an exception context of `context_bytes`
// (with every extended state): 0 where the default holds it (8 KB or less),
// otherwise the context and 8 KB for the dispatch and Anvil's handlers,
// rounded up to whole pages (20 KB for AMX's 11.5 KB).

// marker uses it at exit: such an exit is not clean.
