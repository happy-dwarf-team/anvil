# Anvil

Anvil is a plugin loader for **Europa Universalis IV** (Windows, Steam). It lets
native plugins improve or extend the game **without modifying `eu4.exe`**.

> Status: stage 1 (core loader), early public releases — see
> [Releases](https://github.com/happy-dwarf-team/anvil/releases) and
> [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md). Supported game build: EU4 1.37.5 (Steam,
> Windows 64-bit); on other builds only plugins that use no game addresses load. Design:
> [docs/design.md](docs/design.md). Plugin API 2:
> [include/anvil/anvil_plugin.h](include/anvil/anvil_plugin.h) (C) and
> [include/anvil/anvil.hpp](include/anvil/anvil.hpp) (C++20 wrapper); examples:
> [examples/hello-c](examples/hello-c) and [examples/hello-cpp](examples/hello-cpp).

## How it works (in short)

- Anvil ships as a `version.dll` placed next to `eu4.exe`. Windows loads it
  together with the game; it forwards every `version.dll` call to the system
  copy and, in addition, loads plugins.
- Plugins live in `anvil/plugins/<plugin-id>/` (manifest + DLL). They can also
  come in EU4 mods, from the Steam Workshop or the local mod folder, as
  `anvil/<plugin-id>/` in the mod. Such a plugin loads only while its mod is
  enabled in the playset and only after the player approves its exact files
  in the overlay or in AnvilManager.exe. An update waits for a new approval.
  Approvals are kept in `anvil/trust.toml`, and an approved plugin loads from
  Anvil's own copy in `anvil/data/anvil/approved/`.
- A plugin that uses game addresses declares them, for one EU4 build, in its
  `symbols.toml`; on another build it is skipped. Broken plugins, plugins
  written for an older plugin API or an empty `plugins` folder mean the game
  simply starts as usual. The manifest format is described in
  [docs/design.md](docs/design.md#51-plugintoml-manifest-v2).
- Anvil ships the standard plugin `anvil-game` (`anvil/plugins/anvil-game/`):
  game readiness, a frame event, work on the main thread and game sessions
  ([include/anvil/anvil_game.h](include/anvil/anvil_game.h)). Plugins that
  change the simulation need it: in ironman and multiplayer games Anvil takes
  their changes out unless the player allows them in `anvil/anvil.toml`.
- Anvil also ships `anvil-overlay` (`anvil/plugins/anvil-overlay/`): in-game
  notices about plugins that were not loaded, the previous crash and safe
  mode, and a panel on `Ctrl+Shift+F12` with the status, "disable at the next
  start", the crash report, the log and every plugin's settings. It draws on
  the game's Direct3D 9 renderer and stays off with OpenGL.
- Each start writes `anvil/anvil.log`: what was loaded, what was skipped and why.
- A crash writes a report to `anvil/crashes/` (the last 10 are kept): where it
  happened and which plugins were involved, with each plugin's `issues` link.
  After two starts in a row that ended before the game was ready, the next
  start loads only Anvil's standard plugins (safe mode), and the overlay says
  why.

## Install / uninstall

Download from the
[Releases page](https://github.com/happy-dwarf-team/anvil/releases) (the newest
build is always at
[releases/latest](https://github.com/happy-dwarf-team/anvil/releases/latest)).
`SHA256SUMS.txt` there holds the checksums of the assets.

**With Anvil Manager (`AnvilManager.exe`).** Run it, and it finds the game
through Steam (or lets you pick the folder that contains `eu4.exe`).
"Install Anvil" copies `version.dll`, the standard plugins and the Manager
into that folder; from then on, start the Manager there.
- It shows which plugins will load and why, and turns plugins on and off.
- It installs a plugin from its release zip after checking it against your
  `eu4.exe`, and edits plugin settings.
- It shows crash reports and the log, and starts the game through Steam.
- "Repair" puts back Anvil's own files.
- "Uninstall Anvil" removes `version.dll`, the standard plugins and the
  Manager, and keeps your plugins, their settings and `anvil/anvil.toml`.
  Tick "Also remove my plugins…" to remove the `anvil` folder too.
- To update Anvil, run the Manager of the newer release.
- While the game runs, the Manager only shows. It is not code-signed, so
  Windows SmartScreen may ask once ("More info" → "Run anyway").

**By hand.** Extract `anvil-windows-x64.zip` into the game folder (the
archive has its own `SHA256SUMS.txt` for the extracted files). To uninstall,
delete `version.dll`, `AnvilManager.exe` and the `anvil` folder.

`eu4.exe` is never changed, so Steam updates and "Verify integrity of game
files" keep working. Without `version.dll` the game starts vanilla.

## Building

Requirements: Visual Studio 2022 (or Build Tools) with the C++ workload, CMake
≥ 3.25, Git (dependencies are fetched at configure time: toml++ 3.4.0,
SafetyHook 0.7.0 with Zydis 4.1.0).

```powershell
cmake -S . -B build -G "Visual Studio 17 2022" -A x64
cmake --build build --config Release
ctest --test-dir build -C Release --output-on-failure
cmake --install build --config Release --component anvil --prefix dist   # version.dll + anvil/ layout
```

The build also produces `anvil.exe`, the command-line tool for plugin authors.
It shares the `anvil_core` library (manifests, `symbols.toml` and its
verification, `settings.toml`, the game build identity) with `version.dll`:

```powershell
anvil gen symbols.toml build\generated            # symbols.gen.h and symbols.gen.hpp
anvil gen settings.toml build\generated           # settings.gen.h and settings.gen.hpp
anvil gen --lang rust symbols.toml out            # symbols.gen.rs (Rust plugins, anvil-sys)
anvil check my-plugin --exe "C:\...\eu4.exe"     # verify against the game, write symbols.lock
anvil check my-plugin --format github             # in CI, without the game: schemas and symbols.lock
```

The Rust side (`sdk/rust/anvil-sys`, `examples/hello-rust`, see
[§9](docs/design.md#9-plugin-api-2)) is a Cargo workspace at the root; it needs
Rust 1.82 or newer and the `anvil.exe` built above, which the hello's `build.rs`
runs. CI uses Rust 1.99.1, and `sdk/rust/regen-bindings.ps1` (bindgen 0.73.2 and
libclang) regenerates the committed bindings after a change to the header:

```powershell
$env:ANVIL = "$PWD\build\Release\anvil.exe"
cargo build --workspace
cargo test --workspace
```

See [docs/design.md §16](docs/design.md#16-tooling-for-authors) for the
checks, the instruction-boundary rule and the `symbols.lock` format.
