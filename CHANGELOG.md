## [1.0.0](https://github.com/happy-dwarf-team/anvil/compare/v0.2.0...v1.0.0) (2026-10-20)


### ⚠ BREAKING CHANGES

* **api:** plugin API 1 is removed. Plugins include the new anvil_plugin.h (or anvil.hpp), declare every eu4.exe address in symbols.toml and pass symbol ids (SYM_* / sym::*) instead of RVAs with expected bytes; hook_function, redirect_call and replace_import return their own `next`; expect_bytes, alloc_near_image, ANVIL_EVENT_GAME_READY and the PE fields of AnvilGameInfo are gone; result codes are renumbered.
* **core:** changes an API 1 plugin requests in anvil_plugin_load are enabled only after it returns ANVIL_OK. A second hook, redirect or import replacement at the same address joins a chain instead of failing with ANVIL_ERROR_CONFLICT, expected bytes are compared with the original bytes, and an overlap with the plugin's own change at another address is refused.
* **manifest:** plugin.toml must declare api = 2 and affects_gameplay, and must not use game_builds, [[expect]] or any other unknown key. Plugins with api = 1 are skipped.
