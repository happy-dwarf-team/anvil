# Anvil: design

Status: **draft 3, accepted 2026-10-19.** It specifies Anvil 1.0 with plugin API 2 and collects the decisions of [Map: Anvil 2 specification](https://github.com/happy-dwarf-team/anvil/issues/12). Each section links the ticket that holds the reasoning. How it is delivered is in §22. This document describes the target; the code reaches it through the pull requests of §22.3. Stage 1 (Anvil 0.2, API 1) is described by draft 2 in the git history.

Words in **bold** at first use are defined in [GLOSSARY.md](../GLOSSARY.md).

## 1. Goals

For players:
- Native plugins load into EU4 1.37.5 (Windows, 64-bit) **without modifying `eu4.exe` or any game file**. Removing Anvil returns the game to vanilla.
- An unknown game build, a broken plugin or a crash never prevents the game from starting, and the player is told what happened and why.
- Plugins that change the simulation never act in ironman or multiplayer unless both the author and the player allow it.

For plugin authors:
- A modder who already writes hooks ports one hook in an evening. Every game address is declared once, verified before load and typed in code. The author writes no register-save assembly, no byte profiles and no own proxy DLL.
- Mistakes surface early: a signature mismatch fails to compile, and `anvil check` finds byte, memory and conflict problems without starting the game.

For both:
- Anvil's own cost stays within published budgets (§17), and everything Anvil does is visible in its log.

Non-goals: Linux/macOS, 32-bit, other Paradox games, game builds other than 1.37.5, loading EU4DLL-style `plugins/*.dll` (EU4DLL is treated as legacy), a scripting layer for modders without C/C++.

## 2. Injection: proxy `version.dll` (unchanged)

`eu4.exe` imports `VERSION.dll`, which is not in `KnownDLLs`. Anvil ships as `version.dll` next to `eu4.exe`:
- it forwards the 17 exports to `%SystemRoot%\System32\version.dll`;
- `DllMain` checks that the process is `eu4.exe` and overwrites the executable's entry point with a jump to Anvil;
- at the entry point Anvil restores those bytes, runs the `early` phase and continues into the game.

This is verified for direct starts and through the Paradox launcher (EU4 engine lab, `docs/anvil-real-folder.md`).

## 3. Folder layout

```
<EU4>/eu4.exe
<EU4>/version.dll                      Anvil (proxy + core)
<EU4>/AnvilManager.exe                 player tool, also the installer (§15)
<EU4>/anvil/
    anvil.toml                         enabled, disabled_plugins, profile, log_level, allow_ironman/allow_multiplayer (§13)
    anvil.log, anvil.prev.log
    trust.toml                         approvals of Workshop plugins (§14)
    crashes/<time>.json|.txt|.dmp      last 10 crash reports with minidumps (§12)
    plugins/<plugin-id>/               local plugins: trusted by placement
        plugin.toml  symbols.toml  settings.toml  <entry>.dll  (+ read-only files)
    data/<plugin-id>/                  writable per plugin; settings.toml holds the player's values
    data/anvil/approved/<id>/<hash>/   the previously approved copy of a Workshop plugin
    data/anvil/unfinished-starts.txt   starts in a row that ended before the game was ready (§10)
    data/anvil/crash-shown.txt         the last crash report the overlay announced (§15)
<mod folder of an enabled mod>/anvil/<plugin-id>/   Workshop plugins (§14)
```

## 4. Core and standard plugins

Decided in [What belongs in the Anvil core and what in library plugins](https://github.com/happy-dwarf-team/anvil/issues/17).

**Rule:** a feature belongs to the **core** only if it must work before any plugin loads or needs a view across all plugins at once.

Core:
- discovery, resolution and load order;
- build identity (the core's only game knowledge);
- symbol verification;
- the registry of changes and the chains;
- services and events;
- the approval decision for Workshop plugins;
- crash capture and attribution;
- suspending gameplay plugins (§13);
- plugin status (`anvil.status`) and the log.

The core never shows a blocking dialog.

**Standard plugins** are library plugins maintained by the project and released with Anvil. They load, fail and can be disabled or replaced like any other plugin; dependents of a missing one are skipped with the reason.
- `anvil-game`: game readiness, a frame event, running work on the main thread, and a session event (ironman, multiplayer). Its C interface is [`include/anvil/anvil_game.h`](../include/anvil/anvil_game.h); details in §13.1.
- `anvil-overlay`: notifications, the panel and the settings UI (§15).

Knowledge that only some plugins need (GUI tree, console, text) stays in those plugins and their services.

## 5. A plugin package

### 5.1 `plugin.toml` (manifest v2)

```toml
id = "hello"                        # [a-z0-9-]+, max 64, unique
name = "Hello"
version = "0.1.0"                   # SemVer
authors = ["Your Name"]
description = "..."
api = 2
anvil = ">=1.0.0"                   # optional SemVer range of Anvil
entry = "hello.dll"
phase = "main"                      # "early" | "main"
symbols = "symbols.toml"            # optional; its `build` replaces game_builds
settings = "settings.toml"          # optional
affects_gameplay = false            # REQUIRED (§13)
allow_ironman = false               # false | "opt-in"
allow_multiplayer = false           # false | "opt-in"
load_after = []
issues = "https://github.com/you/hello/issues"   # optional; shown with crash reports
repository = "https://github.com/you/hello"      # optional; shown when approving

[[dependencies]]
id = "anvil-game"
version = "^1"
optional = false

[[conflicts]]                       # this plugin is skipped while a listed one is enabled
id = "other-text-renderer"
version = "<2"
```

Unknown keys are errors ([Offline anvil check CLI and plugin CI](https://github.com/happy-dwarf-team/anvil/issues/23)). `game_builds` and `[[expect]]` are gone: a plugin without `symbols` runs on every build; with `symbols` it runs only on that file's `build`.

### 5.2 `symbols.toml`

Decided in [One source of truth for game addresses](https://github.com/happy-dwarf-team/anvil/issues/18), extended by [Plugin authoring experience](https://github.com/happy-dwarf-team/anvil/issues/21) and [API 2 gaps from the paper port](https://github.com/happy-dwarf-team/anvil/issues/32).

```toml
build = "eu4-1.37.5-steam-win64"

[symbol.speed_object]                         # a function
rva = 0x8024D0
bytes = "48 8B 81 18 04 00 00 C3"             # hex pairs, ?? = any byte
memory = "code"                               # code | read | write
signature = "void* (void* session)"           # typed symbol in C/C++/Rust
note = "session vtable slot 0x100: returns the game-speed object"

[symbol.person_name_block]                    # a block for replace_block (Unicode Patch's person_name_hook)
rva = 0xA4B48C
bytes = "48 8D 55 B8 48 83 7D D0 10 48 0F 43 55 B8 4C 8B 45 C8 48 8B CB E8 4A 7E 64 FF"
memory = "code"
# resume = "<symbol>"                         # optional; default: the end of the block (0xA4B4A6 here)

[symbol.frontend_tick_slot]                   # a pointer slot
rva = 0x1D5A8E8
memory = "read"
points_to = 0x10D2E80

[symbol.root_and_date]                        # values taken from verified bytes
rva = 0x14321FC
bytes = "48 8B 05 75 DC F0 00 8B 98 D0 1D 00 00"
memory = "code"
values.root        = { at = 3, rip_relative = 7, type = "Root" }   # -> sym::root, Data<Root> at 0x233FE78
values.date_offset = { at = 9, size = 4 }                          # -> sym::root_and_date.date_offset = 0x1DD0

[symbol.physfs_get_write_dir]                 # by export name instead of RVA
export = "PHYSFS_getWriteDir"
signature = "const char* ()"
```

- **Kinds:** a symbol is a function (`signature`), a pointer slot (`points_to`), data (`type`) or a site (anything else).
- **Values:** they must lie on fixed bytes.
- **Exports:** an `export` symbol is resolved through the export table; `bytes`, if given, check the prologue.
- **Imports:** the format accepts symbols imported from a shared address library (the library itself is fog, §21).
- **Schema:** unknown keys are errors. Names match `[a-z][a-z0-9_]*` (they become identifiers in generated headers), and a symbol's id is its position in the file. A symbol has exactly one of `rva` and `export`; one at an `rva` needs `memory` and `bytes` or `points_to` (a data symbol may have neither). `signature`, `points_to` and `type` exclude each other. A value has `at` and either `size` (1, 2, 4 or 8, little-endian) or `rip_relative`, the offset of the instruction's end, at least `at + 4`: it yields the RVA `rva + rip_relative + disp32`. `resume` names another symbol and needs `bytes`, the block it ends.

### 5.3 `settings.toml`

Decided in [Plugin configuration convention and the overlay settings panel](https://github.com/happy-dwarf-team/anvil/issues/35).

```toml
[setting.ram_prefetch_budget_mb]
type = "int"                  # bool | int | float | enum | string | key
default = 1024
min = 64
max = 8192
label = "RAM prefetch budget (MB)"
description = "RAM for unpacked archive members the game has not taken yet."
group = "RAM prefetch"
restart = true                # true: applies at the next start

[setting.mode]
type = "enum"
values = [{ name = "off", label = "Off" }, { name = "verify", label = "Verify only" }, { name = "on", label = "On" }]
default = "verify"
label = "Mode"
restart = false               # false: applies at once; the plugin may subscribe

[setting.panel_key]
type = "key"
default = "Ctrl+Shift+F12"
label = "Panel key"
```

- **Schema:** unknown keys are errors, as in the other files. Names match `[a-z][a-z0-9_]*` (max 64; they become identifiers in generated headers), and a setting's id (`AnvilSetting`) is its position in the file. `type`, `default` and `label` are required; `description` and `group` (empty: ungrouped) are optional, and `restart` defaults to `true`, the safe choice for a plugin that reads a value once.
- **Types and values:** `bool`; `int` (64-bit) and `float` (finite; an integer is accepted) with optional `min`, `max` and `step` (the editor's increment, greater than 0, not a rule for values); `enum` with `values`, an array of `{ name, label }` (the label defaults to the name), whose `default` and stored values are option names; `string` (UTF-8, no NUL); `key`, a binding such as `"Ctrl+Shift+F12"` or `""` for none. `min`/`max` belong to `int` and `float` only, `values` to `enum` only, and `default` must satisfy the limits.
- **Keys:** modifiers `Ctrl` (or `Control`), `Shift`, `Alt`, each at most once, then one key: `A`–`Z`, `0`–`9`, `F1`–`F24`, `Space`, `Enter`, `Escape`, `Tab`, `Backspace`, `Insert`, `Delete`, `Home`, `End`, `PageUp`, `PageDown`, the arrows (`Up`, `Down`, `Left`, `Right`), `Pause`, `PrintScreen`, `CapsLock`, `NumLock`, `ScrollLock`, `Numpad0`–`Numpad9`, `NumpadAdd`/`Subtract`/`Multiply`/`Divide`/`Decimal`, and the US-layout punctuation keys `Semicolon`, `Equals`, `Comma`, `Minus`, `Period`, `Slash`, `Backquote`, `LeftBracket`, `Backslash`, `RightBracket`, `Quote`; names are case-insensitive. The value a plugin reads is the Windows virtual-key code in bits 0–7 with `0x100` Shift, `0x200` Ctrl and `0x400` Alt, as the Win32 hot-key control encodes it.

## 6. Game build identity

Anvil reads the PE header of the running image (TimeDateStamp, SizeOfImage, CheckSum, entry point) and maps it to a build id from a compiled-in table. The full SHA-256 is checked off the critical path and cached. With an unknown build, plugins with `symbols` are skipped with "game build unknown (EU4 updated?)", and the overlay says so: it runs on every build. Other storefront builds are not supported yet ([Other distributions of EU4 1.37.5](https://github.com/happy-dwarf-team/anvil/issues/36), §21).

## 7. Verification before loading

For each plugin, before its DLL is loaded and before any plugin has changed anything, Anvil:
1. parses `plugin.toml`, `symbols.toml` and `settings.toml`; an unknown key or a schema error skips the plugin;
2. resolves `export` symbols;
3. compares every symbol with the image: `(actual & mask) == (expected & mask)`, the memory kind against the section flags, and `points_to` against the stored pointer;
4. computes `values`.

Bytes already changed by other plugins are compared in their original form, so two plugins can depend on the same function. A mismatch skips the plugin, logging the symbol, the RVA and the first differing byte. `anvil check` runs the same code offline (§16).

## 8. Changes

Decided in [Hook API 2: hook kinds, chaining and conflict policy](https://github.com/happy-dwarf-team/anvil/issues/19) and [API 2 gaps from the paper port](https://github.com/happy-dwarf-team/anvil/issues/32). Facts: [SafetyHook research](https://github.com/happy-dwarf-team/anvil/issues/14).

### 8.1 Seven kinds of change

| Kind | Call | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Function hook | `hook_function(sym, detour, &next)` | detour with its own `next` |
| Mid hook | `mid_hook(sym, callback, user)` | callback gets `AnvilCpuContext`; the original code runs afterwards |
| Block replacement | `replace_block(sym, callback, user)` | the declared block never runs; resume at `resume` or at the block's end |
| Call redirect | `redirect_call(sym, target, &next)` | `call rel32` sites |
| Byte patch | `patch_bytes(sym, bytes, size)` | expected bytes come from the declaration |
| Pointer swap | `swap_pointer(sym, value, &previous)` | atomic; also in read-only memory |
| Import replacement | `replace_import(module, function, replacement, &next)` | `eu4.exe` imports |

In addition, `address_of(sym)` gives a verified address to call or read.

Every call that touches `eu4.exe` takes a declared symbol, never a raw RVA. Raw pointers are accepted only **outside** the `eu4.exe` image (`hook_function_at` and friends, e.g. Direct3D 9 vtables). Those still go through the registry and chains, with an optional prologue check.

**Pointer swap.**
- It takes a slot symbol whose pointer still holds its `points_to`; the slot must be 8-byte aligned.
- The slot is written with one atomic store. In read-only memory, Anvil changes the page's protection only for that store, keeping it executable if it was.
- `previous` is a value, not code, so there is no stub to re-point. Instead Anvil keeps the plugin's `previous` location: it writes the next value of the chain there at the request and again, atomically, whenever the chain changes.
  - When an inner link leaves, the link outside it reads the following value through its `previous`.
  - Anvil stops writing to a location once its change is removed.
  - The location must therefore stay valid while the change lives (a global or a field of a long-lived object), and the plugin reads it each time it passes on, never a copy.
- `previous` may be NULL when the plugin does not pass on.
- When the last link leaves, the slot gets back the pointer it held before the chain began. A slot that the game rewrote while nobody swapped it starts the next chain from its current value.

### 8.2 Chains

- Anvil owns one SafetyHook hook per address and chains the plugins itself.
- Order follows the load order (dependencies, `load_after`): the earlier plugin is outermost. There are no priorities.
- Every link has its own `next`. Redirects and pointer swaps chain with `next` being the previous target or value; a pointer swap's `previous` follows the chain as §8.1 describes.
- Links can be removed in any order. Executable memory (stubs, trampolines) is never freed.
- At one address, mid hooks run first, then a block replacement or the function-hook chain or the redirected call.
- A mid hook that changes `rip` ends the chain; the first occurrence per address and session is logged.

### 8.3 Conflicts and unsafe sites

- A change whose bytes overlap another plugin's change at a different address is refused, and both owners are logged. A block replacement owns its whole block.
- The one exception: identical byte patches share ownership.
- A hook whose stolen bytes contain `JRCXZ` or `LOOP*` is refused, because SafetyHook mis-encodes them.

### 8.4 Staging, handles, suspension

- Changes requested during `anvil_plugin_load` are staged and enabled together after it returns `ANVIL_OK`; on failure none are enabled.
- Later changes are atomic one by one or as an explicit group.
- Every change returns a handle and can be removed. A failed load rolls back everything the plugin had.
- The core can **suspend and resume all changes of a plugin**: it bypasses its links, reverts its patches and restores its pointers (§13).
  - A suspended link keeps its place in its chain. Its own `next` (or `previous`) still leads to the rest, so a thread inside it passes on.
  - A byte patch shared with a plugin that is not suspended stays written.
  - Suspended changes keep their bytes reserved: a suspended block replacement still owns its block. Changes the plugin requests while suspended are enabled suspended.
  - Suspending and resuming are idempotent. The plugin alone gets `anvil.suspended` after its changes are out of the game and `anvil.resumed` after they are back, once per change of state, so it can stop and restart its threads.
  - Removing a suspended change or rolling the plugin back works as for any other change.
- All kinds are allowed in every phase; SafetyHook's page trapping covers threads.

### 8.5 `AnvilCpuContext`

- The layout is identical to SafetyHook's `Context64` (408 bytes): XMM0–15, RFLAGS, the GPRs, `rsp` (read-only), a reserved slot (`trampoline_rsp`) and `rip` (writable). It is pinned with `static_assert`s.
- YMM upper halves, x87 and MXCSR are not saved.
- Anvil runs a copy of SafetyHook 0.7's stub, so a later SafetyHook cannot change the ABI: one context save for all mid hooks at an address and the block replacement. One copy serves every address; each address enters it through its own 24-byte thunk that pushes the address's state as `rip`, which the dispatch loop replaces with the resume address before any callback runs.
- A lighter, volatile-only context is not offered in 1.0 (§17).

## 9. Plugin API 2

The C ABI is [`include/anvil/anvil_plugin.h`](../include/anvil/anvil_plugin.h) (`ANVIL_API_VERSION 2`); plugins vendor it. API 1 is gone: no bridge, and the manifest accepts only `api = 2` (§22.2).
- **Host table:** log, `plugin_dir`, `data_dir`, game info (build id, image base and size, the SHA-256 once verified), the change calls of §8, `remove`, groups, `address_of`, `symbol_value`, services, events (`anvil.plugins_loaded`, `anvil.suspended`, `anvil.resumed`), and settings (§11). Anvil fills every field.
  - A change handle (`AnvilChange*`) is the registry's change id; ids are never reused, so a stale handle is `ANVIL_ERROR_NOT_FOUND`. While the process exits, `remove` does nothing.
  - Inside `anvil_plugin_load` the load is the plugin's group: `begin_group`/`commit_group` return `ANVIL_ERROR_WRONG_PHASE` there.
  - Results map the registry's one to one; `NOT_FOUND` and `ALREADY_EXISTS` (services) are the last two codes.
  - Events are named like services: a plugin publishes only `<its id>.<name>`, so no plugin can forge another's events (the core acts on `anvil-game.session`, §13); `anvil.` names are Anvil's. Any plugin may subscribe to any name.
- **Versioning:** the `size` and `api_version` fields keep it extensible; within API 2 functions are only appended (`ANVIL_HOST_HAS`) after the "end of API 2.0" line.
- **Generated headers:** `anvil gen` produces `symbols.gen.h/.hpp` (symbol ids, typed function symbols, values) and `settings.gen.h/.hpp` (typed accessors).
- **C++ wrapper** ([`anvil.hpp`](../include/anvil/anvil.hpp), header-only, C++20):
  - `ANVIL_PLUGIN(Type)` with `Type : anvil::Plugin`; a failing call in `load()` throws `anvil::Error` (the host's result and a message), the macro turns any exception into a result, and Anvil rolls back;
  - callables the wrapper adapts (mid hooks, block replacements, event handlers) must not throw: the adapter catches, logs the first exception per change and the game continues. Function-hook detours, redirect targets and import replacements are plain functions the game calls directly; they must not throw (`noexcept`);
  - `anvil::HookOf<sym::x>` (a `FunctionHook` whose `next` Anvil writes before enabling), `PointerSwap<T>` (keeps `previous` where Anvil can rewrite it); mid hooks and block replacements take any callable, kept for the process;
  - a signature mismatch (detour, call arguments, hook object) fails with a `static_assert`; each symbol has its own generated type (`sym::Types::<name>`), so the compiler's note names it;
  - `Host` is a stateless value (`anvil::Host{}` works anywhere once the plugin is loading); typed `call`, `function`, `data` (`Data<T>`, also typed `rip_relative` values) and `value`;
  - `Change` is a move-only handle: destroying it removes the change, `release()` keeps it.
- **Rust** ([Rust SDK tier and timing](https://github.com/happy-dwarf-team/anvil/issues/22)): `anvil-sys`, `anvil gen --lang rust` and a Rust hello in CI. The safe `anvil` crate comes later, with recorded principles: `#[anvil::plugin]` returning `Result`, `catch_unwind` adapters, typed symbols, `Drop` handles, a `#[repr(C)]` context.
  - **`anvil-sys`** (`sdk/rust/anvil-sys`, `no_std`, no dependencies, `rust-version` 1.82, which CI does not test: it builds with 1.99.1):
    - `src/bindings.rs` is bindgen's output for [`anvil_plugin.h`](../include/anvil/anvil_plugin.h), committed. `sdk/rust/regen-bindings.ps1` writes it (pinned bindgen, target `x86_64-pc-windows-msvc`, bindgen's own formatter, so the output does not depend on the machine); CI runs it with `-Check` and fails when the file differs, so a change of the header comes with its bindings.
    - C enums are integer constants (`AnvilResult`, `ANVIL_OK`), not Rust enums: a value the host sends is never invalid. Host table fields are `Option<unsafe extern "C" fn>`; `ANVIL_HOST_HAS` is a C macro, so a Rust plugin that needs a field added after API 2.0 compares `size` with `offset_of!` itself.
    - `AnvilCpuContext` is `#[repr(C)]`; the crate asserts at compile time its size (408), alignment, the offsets of `rflags`, `rax`, `rsp` and `rip`, and `ANVIL_API_VERSION`. `AnvilPluginLoadFn` is the type of the one function a plugin exports; the crate declares no extern functions.
    - Its version is Anvil's (release-please updates it with `version.txt`), and the release workflow publishes it to crates.io with the `CARGO_REGISTRY_TOKEN` secret. Without the secret the step only warns; the release is then published by hand at its tag.
  - **`anvil gen --lang rust`** writes `symbols.gen.rs` (and `settings.gen.rs`) only, to be included in a module (`mod sym { include!(…) }`, as the Rust hello's `build.rs` does):
    - `pub const <NAME>: anvil_sys::AnvilSymbol` ids, `pub type <Name>Fn = unsafe extern "C" fn(…) -> …` from `signature`, and `pub const <SYMBOL>_<VALUE>: u64` values (RVAs for `rip_relative`), as in the C header. A detour assigned to a `<Name>Fn` is checked by the compiler, the counterpart of the C++ `static_assert`. Two names that become the same Rust name are an error.
    - Types translated: pointers (with their `const`), `char`, `short`, `int`, `long` (32 bits), `long long` with `signed`/`unsigned`, `float`, `double`, `bool`, `void`, `<stdint.h>` types, `size_t`, `intptr_t`, `uintptr_t`, `ptrdiff_t`, `wchar_t`, and `...`. A pointer to any other type is `*mut c_void` (`*const c_void` for `const`), quietly. Anything else by value (a struct, a function pointer, an array) is `*mut c_void` too, with a warning that names the symbol (`symbols.toml:<line>: warning: …`, also as a comment in the file) because the ABI may not match.
    - `settings.gen.rs` (for a `settings.toml` in the same call): `pub const <NAME>: anvil_sys::AnvilSetting` ids, `pub const <NAME>_<OPTION>: i64` indices of enum options, and with a key setting `KEY_SHIFT`, `KEY_CTRL`, `KEY_ALT` and `KEY_VK_MASK`, as `settings.gen.h` has them. The plugin reads values with the host table (`setting_bool`, `setting_int`, …); typed accessors are the safe crate's business. A name two settings or options both give is an error.
  - **`examples/hello-rust`** (`cdylib`, static CRT): the hello of the C and C++ examples with the raw API. `anvil_plugin_load` and every function Anvil or the game calls run under `catch_unwind` (unwinding out of an `extern "C"` function aborts), and a panic hook writes the panic to the plugin's log. CI builds it for `x86_64-pc-windows-msvc` with clippy, rustfmt and its unit tests, loads it through the same host table as the other examples (`plugin_tests`), and ships it in the package next to them. `tests/rust/gen-compile` assigns Rust functions to the generated types, so a wrong translation does not compile.

## 10. Load order and failure policy

1. The proxy is set up (always); the entry-point hook is placed in `eu4.exe` only.
2. At the entry point: no `anvil/` folder means nothing happens. `ANVIL_DISABLE=1` or `enabled = false` means the log only.
3. **Safe mode:** two consecutive crashes before the game is ready (`anvil-game.ready`, §12, §13.1) mean this start loads no plugins except the standard ones the overlay needs to explain it.
   - Each start counts itself in `anvil/data/anvil/unfinished-starts.txt` before anything can crash. `anvil-game.ready` removes the file, unless this start already wrote a crash report: EU4's handler may let the game go on to the menu after a crash on another thread, and such a start stays counted. An exit before readiness without a crash puts the previous count back (a crash: a report was written, or a fatal-looking exception came in the last 30 s, which the game's own handler may have caught). A start that crashed, hung or was killed before the game was ready stays counted, whatever caught the crash.
   - A count of 2 makes this start safe: the file is removed and the log says why. The plugins are listed as skipped ("safe mode"). The next start loads them again.
   - Without `anvil-game` (disabled or missing) there is no ready signal, so a crash at any time of a session counts.
   - The standard plugins `anvil-game` and `anvil-overlay` still load in safe mode, so the overlay can explain it. One of them is left out ("safe mode; the crash before it was …") when a report of the starts that led to safe mode puts the crash in its code or its change (`in_plugin_code`, `in_plugin_change`), so the safe start cannot end the same way. Those reports are the newest ones written before the game was ready, at most one per counted start; a start that hung or was killed wrote none, so an older report may stand in for it.
4. The build is identified.
5. Plugins are discovered: local `anvil/plugins/*`, and Workshop plugins in enabled mods (approved versions only, §14).
6. Resolve and verify:
   - API version and the `anvil` range;
   - the build of `symbols`;
   - duplicates (the local plugin wins over a Workshop one with the same id);
   - disabled ids;
   - the symbols (§7);
   - `conflicts` (the declaring plugin is skipped, see below);
   - dependencies and cycles. A plugin with `affects_gameplay = true` depends on `anvil-game` (any version) without declaring it, because only `anvil-game` tells Anvil about ironman and multiplayer (§13): without it the plugin is skipped with "affects gameplay, so it needs plugin 'anvil-game', which is not loaded".

   **Conflicts.** A plugin that declares a `conflicts` entry is skipped when a plugin with that id and a version in the range is among the candidates that passed the checks above; the other plugin loads normally. The log says `conflicts with <id> <version>; disable one of them`. Whatever depends on a skipped plugin is skipped by the dependency check, as usual. Edge cases are resolved the same way on every start, whatever the discovery order:

   - A plugin that is itself skipped for a conflict does not count as a target. Plugins that conflict with nothing alive are kept first, and whoever declares a conflict with one of them is skipped. So with `a` conflicting with `b` and `b` with `c`, `b` is skipped and `a` and `c` load.
   - When only cycles are left, the smallest id (byte order) is skipped and the rest is resolved again. Two plugins that conflict with each other leave the one with the larger id; in `a -> b -> c -> a`, `a` is skipped, then `b` because of `c`, and `c` loads.
   - A conflict with a plugin that is absent, disabled, rejected by the API, `anvil` or symbols checks, or outside the version range is ignored.
   - A candidate that is skipped later, because its own dependency is missing or in a cycle, still counts as a conflict target: conflicts are resolved before dependencies.
7. `early` plugins are loaded at the entry point, then `main` plugins on an Anvil thread. Each plugin's staged changes are enabled when its load returns. A plugin whose required dependency failed to load is not loaded either ("requires plugin '<id>', which failed to load").
8. `anvil.plugins_loaded` is published and the status is recorded.

## 11. Settings

- Defaults live in `settings.toml` in the plugin folder, read-only (§5.3). A plugin whose `settings.toml` does not parse is skipped with the parser's reason, like a broken `symbols.toml` (§7); `anvil check` reports it at its line.
- The player's values live in `anvil/data/<id>/settings.toml`, only the values that differ from the default; the file can be edited by hand. It is a flat table, `name = value` in the types of §5.3 (an enum option's name, a key binding as text):
  ```toml
  ram_prefetch_budget_mb = 2048
  mode = "on"
  ```
- An invalid value (wrong type, out of range, not an option, not a key) falls back to the default, with a warning in the log and the overlay; so does a name the plugin does not declare (ignored), and a file that does not parse leaves every setting at its default.
- `ANVIL_<ID>_<NAME>` environment variables override values for testing (the plugin id and the name in upper case, `-` as `_`), and Anvil logs each one: `true`/`false`/`1`/`0`, a decimal int, a number, an option's name, any string, a key binding. An invalid one is a warning and is ignored. An override changes what the plugin reads in this session, never the player's file.
- The values are read once, before the plugin loads, and are always valid when the plugin sees them.
- Plugins read validated values through generated accessors (§16): `cfg::<name>.get()` in C++; `host->setting_bool/int/float/string(self, CFG_<NAME>)` in C. `setting_int` also reads a bool (0/1), an enum (the option's index, `CFG_<NAME>_<OPTION>`) and a key (the code); `setting_float` an int; `setting_string` an enum (the option's name) and a key (`"Ctrl+F12"`). Any other combination, and an unknown id, reads 0, 0.0 or `""`. A string stays valid for the process.
- For `restart = false` settings plugins can subscribe to changes (`subscribe_setting`, or `anvil::Host::subscribe_setting(cfg::<name>, handler)`, which does not compile for a `restart = true` setting). The host refuses an unknown setting with `ANVIL_ERROR_NOT_DECLARED` and a `restart = true` one with `ANVIL_ERROR_WRONG_KIND`. Callbacks run synchronously on the thread that made the change, after the new value is in place; a plugin whose load fails loses its subscriptions.
- **Changing a value while the game runs** (the overlay, 1.1): the core holds each resolved plugin's settings in a `PluginSettings` (`src/core/plugin_settings.hpp`), found by `anvil::plugin_settings(id)` (`runtime.hpp`). `set(id, value)` (or `set_text`, `reset`) checks the value, saves the player's file (atomically, through a temporary file; with only defaults it is removed), and for a `restart = false` setting makes it the current value and runs the callbacks; a `restart = true` setting keeps its current value until the next start (`current` and `saved` tell the editor whether to show "applies at the next start"). A change replaces an environment override for the rest of the session. The overlay, a plugin itself, reaches these calls through the core's private service `anvil.control` (§15); the warnings of the start-up are in `warnings()`.
- **Outside the game** (the Manager, 1.2): `anvil_core` has the same rules without the running game: `load_settings`, `load_player_settings` and `write_player_settings` (`src/core/settings.hpp`), `parse_setting_text` and `setting_toml` for text, `check_setting_value`. Edits are safe only while the game is closed: a running game rewrites the file on the next change in the overlay.
- Settings are global per plugin; profiles are fog.

## 12. Crash capture and attribution

Decided in [Crash attribution to plugins](https://github.com/happy-dwarf-team/anvil/issues/24).

- **Capture**
  - The core registers a VEH at the entry point. It records fatal-looking exceptions in memory only: no IO, at most 8.
  - An unhandled-exception filter chained ahead of EU4's writes the report, then hands over to EU4's own crash reporter.
    - Anvil sets its filter before the game's C runtime starts and replaces eu4.exe's import of `SetUnhandledExceptionFilter` (1.37.5 imports it from `KERNEL32.dll`). The game's own calls then only record their filter as Anvil's next one and get back the filter they replaced. Anvil's filter stays on top: it has the report written, calls the game's filter and returns its result.
    - At `anvil-game.ready` the core checks that its filter is still the top-level one. A filter set through another module's import stays on top, and the log names it.
  - A helper thread prepared at start-up writes every report while the crashed thread waits. It has its own stack, `MiniDumpWriteDump` loaded and the minidump file already open.
    - The report is built in fixed buffers: no allocation and no lock. The registry is asked with try-locks, and the crashed thread's memory is read with `ReadProcessMemory`. A fault while writing leaves a partial report with a note.
    - After the report the helper adds a small minidump (`MiniDumpNormal` with thread info and unloaded modules) and rewrites the report to name it. A dump writer stuck on a lock of the crashed thread costs only the dump. Until then the file waits as `pending-<pid>.dmp`, which the system deletes when the process ends without a kept dump.
    - On a stack overflow the VEH hands over at once, because the filter may have no stack left. The game's main thread gets a 64 KB stack guarantee for the handlers.
    - Windows calls the filter from a thread's start, which it reaches by unwinding, and it cannot unwind through a context stub (no unwind data). So the dispatch loop of mid hooks and block replacements calls the unhandled-exception filter itself, as a thread's start does, for an exception a callback leaves unhandled; without it such a crash ended the game with no report (1.0).
  - Not caught: `__fastfail` and `/GS` failures (they bypass both), `TerminateProcess`, and an exception that a frame handler of the game catches before the filter. One report per process.
- **Report:** `anvil/crashes/<time>.json` and `.txt`, with the minidump `<time>.dmp`, keeping the last 10. It contains:
  - the code and the address as module + offset;
  - for `eu4.exe` addresses, the nearest declared symbol and whether a plugin's change covers it;
  - for stubs and trampolines, the change, plugin and symbol;
  - the unwound stack with every frame attributed;
    - frames come from unwind data (`RtlVirtualUnwind`). Anvil's stubs have none: a return address in the context stub continues from its saved `AnvilCpuContext` at the site (the stub is shared, so the dispatch loop leaves the site's state in a spare slot of the stub's frame for the walk), and a trampoline is unwound as the game instructions it copies. Anything else without unwind data (other stubs, code of no module) switches to a scan of the stack for return addresses, marked "scan" (they may be stale);
    - repeated frames (a recursion) are counted, not listed;
  - the registers, the plugins with versions and `issues` links, the build, the earlier fatal-looking exceptions of the VEH, and the tail of the log.
- **Levels:** "in plugin X's code", "in plugin X's change", "plugin X on the stack", or "no plugin involved". Never "X caused it".
  - In X's code: the crash address is in X's DLL. In X's change: it is in game bytes, a stub or a trampoline of X's change (every owner of a shared one). On the stack: a later frame is in X's DLL or change. The JSON has the level as `in_plugin_code`, `in_plugin_change`, `plugin_on_stack` or `no_plugin`.
- **Next start:** a notice in the overlay with "disable X at the next start" (only on click), and safe mode after two crashes before the game is ready (`anvil-game.ready`). Nothing is uploaded; "copy report" plus the `issues` link.

## 13. Gameplay-affecting plugins

Decided in [Gameplay-affecting plugins in ironman, achievements and multiplayer](https://github.com/happy-dwarf-team/anvil/issues/29).

- **`affects_gameplay`** is required: `true` if the plugin can change the simulation's state or results.
- **Suspension:** `anvil-game` publishes a session event. In ironman or multiplayer the core suspends every change of gameplay plugins (§8.4), the plugin is told so it can stop its threads, and the changes come back after the session.
- **Opt-in:** `allow_ironman` / `allow_multiplayer = "opt-in"` let the player allow a plugin in that mode; the choice is stored in `anvil.toml`:
  ```toml
  allow_ironman = ["my-plugin"]       # ids; only plugins whose plugin.toml offers allow_ironman = "opt-in"
  allow_multiplayer = []
  ```
  A session that is both ironman and multiplayer needs both. An id listed for a mode its plugin does not offer, or for a plugin that does not affect gameplay, does nothing; the log says so when the plugin is resolved.
- **Achievements:** with an ironman opt-in active, the overlay shows a permanent notice that achievements stay enabled but may break Paradox's rules.
- **Multiplayer:** the overlay shows a hash of the active gameplay plugin set for players to compare by hand.
- **Without `anvil-game`** nothing would report sessions, so gameplay plugins depend on it implicitly (§10): they are skipped when it is missing, disabled or skipped, and not loaded when it fails to load.

**How the core applies it** (`src/core/gameplay_policy.cpp`):
- The core subscribes to `anvil-game.session` before any plugin loads, so it acts before plugins hear of a session. Only `anvil-game` can publish that name (§9).
- On a session start it computes, for each gameplay plugin in load order, whether the mode allows it, suspends the others (`anvil.suspended` after their changes are out) and logs each decision with the reason and the number of changes; plugins it allows are logged as such. On the end it resumes them (`anvil.resumed` after the changes are back). A start that follows a start (the mode changed) suspends or resumes only the difference.
- A plugin that loads while a session runs starts suspended: its changes are enabled suspended. A plugin whose load failed is left alone.

### 13.1 `anvil-game`

A standard plugin (`plugins/anvil-game`, released in `anvil/plugins/anvil-game/`), `phase = "early"` so that early plugins can depend on it, `affects_gameplay = false`. Its `symbols.toml` declares every address and offset it reads (11 symbols, checked with `anvil check --exe`; the lock is committed and checked in CI). It hooks the frame function (`0x14C25A0(app, outer)`); after each frame of the main loop (`outer = 1`) on the main thread (the thread of the first such frame) while the game is not quitting (`app+0x83`, `app+0x2F8`) it does, in this order:

1. **Readiness:** the first frame after the game sets its ready flag (the byte at `0x233FF4E`, set once at the end of start-up) publishes `anvil-game.ready`. The core logs `game ready at … ms` from it; the core itself no longer knows the flag.
2. **Session:** a session runs when the root object (`0x233FE78`) holds a session of the game's class (vtable `0x1CB8460`, verified through its slot `+0x100`), that session has a game-speed object, and the date is set. Ironman is the root byte `+0x24D0`, multiplayer the game's own check `0x6EAA10(session)`, the two inputs of the console's multiplayer/ironman gate. A change of the session object, of ironman or of multiplayer ends the session and starts a new one; `anvil-game.session` carries `STARTED` or `ENDED` with the flags and a number. Reads that fault (a half-built root) change nothing. Quitting from a session publishes no `ENDED`.
3. **Work:** what `run_on_main_thread` queued before this frame, in order.
4. **Frame:** `anvil-game.frame` with the game's frame counter (`app+0x320`).

Frames drawn inside a game update or a save load (`outer = 0`) and frames on other threads are passed on untouched. Saves load inside one frame of the main loop (a static finding of the lab), so a session should start at the end of the frame that loaded it, before the next game update; this is not yet checked in the game.

Service `anvil-game.game` version 1: `ready()`, `main_thread_id()`, `frame_number()`, `run_on_main_thread(work, context)` and `session(&out)`. Queued work never runs once the game quits, and frames stop while a save loads, so callers wait with a limit.

## 14. Workshop distribution and trust

Decided in [Workshop distribution and trust model](https://github.com/happy-dwarf-team/anvil/issues/25). Facts: [Workshop research](https://github.com/happy-dwarf-team/anvil/issues/16).

[Run the Workshop experiments E1 and E2](https://github.com/happy-dwarf-team/anvil/issues/34) found:
- **E1:** a mod with only `descriptor.mod` + `anvil/**` keeps the 1.37.5 checksum and allows ironman achievements.
- **E2:** a private upload through the Paradox launcher delivered the DLL byte-identical, with no warnings; the launcher only adds `remote_file_id` to `descriptor.mod`.

- **Discovery:** only mods enabled in the current playset (`dlc_load.json` → `.mod` → `path`), in `anvil/<plugin-id>/` folders, several per mod. This also gates a plugin on its mod being enabled.
- **Trust:**
  - an approval covers a SHA-256 over the whole plugin folder;
  - `trust.toml` records the id, version, Workshop id, hash and date;
  - the Manager can revoke an approval.
- **Updates:** a new hash is pending; the previously approved copy (`data/anvil/approved/`) keeps running until the new one is approved.
- **First approval:**
  - the overlay asks once the game runs, and the plugin loads from the next start;
  - the Manager can approve before launch;
  - the prompt shows the name, authors, version, mod, `affects_gameplay`, symbol count, hash, `repository` and a native-code warning.
- **Anvil itself** cannot be installed by the Workshop (items never land next to `eu4.exe`); the Manager installs it (§15).

## 15. Player UI

Decided in [Player UI: in-game overlay and Anvil Manager](https://github.com/happy-dwarf-team/anvil/issues/26).

- **`anvil-overlay`**
  - Drawing: Dear ImGui on D3D9 (`EndScene`/`Reset` via `hook_function_at`, chained with other D3D9 hooks); input by subclassing the game window's WndProc. It turns itself off on the OpenGL backend (fog).
  - Notifications: non-blocking, for skipped plugins, the previous crash, pending approvals/updates and safe mode.
  - Panel on `Ctrl+Shift+F12`:
    - status and reasons;
    - approvals;
    - "disable at the next start";
    - the crash report;
    - the log tail;
    - the settings editor.
  - It never pauses the game. Plugins get no ImGui context.
  - **How it is built** (`plugins/anvil-overlay`, `phase = "early"`, `affects_gameplay = false`, an optional dependency on `anvil-game`):
    - The device: at the entry point it hooks `Direct3DCreate9` and `Direct3DCreate9Ex` in `d3d9.dll` with `hook_function_at`. eu4.exe imports both, but its renderer also looks them up with `GetProcAddress`: in the lab (1.37.5) a replaced import was never called, so the exports themselves are hooked. On the object they return it hooks `CreateDevice` (and `CreateDeviceEx`) with `hook_function_at`, and on the device `EndScene`, `Reset` (and `ResetEx`). No symbols, so it runs on every build. On OpenGL none of this is called; at `anvil-game.ready` the log says the overlay is off.
    - Dear ImGui (a pinned release tag, linked statically; the core, the Win32 and the Direct3D 9 backends, without XInput, IME or shell functions) draws only on the back buffer. With no notice shown and the panel closed the `EndScene` hook only passes on: no ImGui frame. The context and the font atlas are made the first time something is shown.
    - Input: the game window's procedure is subclassed. The panel key (a setting, `Ctrl+Shift+F12`) toggles the panel, Escape closes it. While something is shown, mouse and keyboard messages go to ImGui; those it wants (`WantCaptureMouse`, and `WantCaptureKeyboard` while the panel is open) do not reach the game, `WM_INPUT` included, and the game's own polling (`GetAsyncKeyState`, `GetKeyState`, imports of eu4.exe) reads those keys as up. Releases always reach the game.
    - Notices start when the game is ready (`anvil-game.ready`; without `anvil-game`, with the first frame): safe mode, a new previous crash with "disable X at the next start" for the plugins it was in (code or change level), and the plugins that were not loaded (not those the player disabled). They close after `notification_seconds` or on a click. During a session it shows the ironman notice of §13 while a gameplay plugin acts by opt-in, and the plugin-set hash in multiplayer; neither can be closed.
    - The panel has tabs for the status (plugins, reasons, warnings, "disable at the next start"), the settings editor (values as the player's file holds them, "applies at the next start" for `restart = true`, reset to the default, keys recorded from a key press), the crash report ("copy report", the `issues` link) and the log tail.
    - ImGui writes no `imgui.ini`; the clipboard is used only on the player's click or Ctrl+C/Ctrl+V in a text field.
  - **`anvil.control` v1**, the core's private service for the overlay ([`src/control/anvil_control.h`](../src/control/anvil_control.h), a C table like any service). It is not in the SDK and may change in a minor release; the Manager uses `anvil_core` instead. Every call may come from any thread.
    - Status: the Anvil version, the build, safe mode and the count of unfinished starts, each plugin (resolved, then skipped) with its state, the reason it failed or was skipped, whether it is suspended and whether it is disabled from the next start. Plugin states are reported once every plugin was processed. The warnings and errors the log got (most of them at start-up).
    - The current session from the gameplay policy, the number of gameplay plugins that act in it, and the hash of §13: the start of a SHA-256 over the `id version` lines of those plugins, shown as `XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX`.
    - Settings: the schema of each resolved plugin, values as text (current, saved, default) and the changes of §11 (`set`, `set_text`, `reset`), with the warnings of the player's file.
    - The previous crash: the newest report written before this start, with its level, summary, involved plugins, `issues` link and text. It is "new" until a start has shown it; the first call in a process records its name in `anvil/data/anvil/crash-shown.txt`.
    - The log tail: the end of `anvil.log`, read from the file.
    - "Disable at the next start": the id goes into `disabled_plugins` of `anvil/anvil.toml`, only on the player's click. The file keeps every other line and comment: the id is inserted into the existing list, or the key is added before the first table. The edit must read back as the same file plus the id; it is written to a temporary file and replaces the old one in one step. A file that does not parse is not touched.
- **`AnvilManager.exe`** (C++ and Dear ImGui, static):
  - finds the game (Steam `libraryfolders.vdf`);
  - installs, repairs and uninstalls Anvil from its own package;
  - enables plugins, approves and revokes;
  - shows what will load and why (`anvil check --game --format json`);
  - shows crashes and logs, and launches through `steam://rungameid/236850`;
  - has an opt-in GitHub release check that only shows a link. Nothing is downloaded.
  - **How it is built** (`tools/manager`, decided in [#59](https://github.com/happy-dwarf-team/anvil/issues/59)):
    - One exe that is also the installer. The build zips `cmake --install --component anvil` of the same build (`version.dll`, `anvil/` with the standard plugins, the default `anvil.toml` and the docs) into the resource `ANVIL_PACKAGE`; `AnvilManager.exe --check-package` reads it back. Updating Anvil means running a newer Manager.
    - `anvil_manager_core` (no window) holds what it does, with `anvil_manager_tests`:
      - the game from the registry's Steam path, `steamapps/libraryfolders.vdf` (both formats) and `appmanifest_236850.acf`, with a folder picker as fallback; `eu4.exe` is hashed against the known builds (§6);
      - install, update and repair as one plan: missing or differing package files, extra files in a standard plugin's folder, `anvil.toml` only when missing, the Manager's own copy at `<EU4>/AnvilManager.exe` when its bytes differ, and `version.dll` last;
      - a `version.dll` whose version resource does not name Anvil belongs to another mod and is replaced only on the player's word;
      - uninstall removes `version.dll` first (the game is vanilla at once), then the standard plugins, Anvil's docs and `AnvilManager.exe`. It keeps the player's plugins, `anvil/data`, the crash reports in `anvil/crashes` (an empty folder goes), the logs and `anvil.toml`; "remove everything" removes `anvil/`. Removing folders never follows junctions. When the running Manager is the copy in the folder, a copy of it in the temporary folder removes it after exit, and the next Manager removes that copy;
      - plugin zips (`<id>/…` as the template releases them, a flat zip or `anvil/plugins/<id>/…`). The shallowest `plugin.toml` names the plugin's folder, and files beside it (a release's `SHA256SUMS.txt`) are not installed. The zip is checked before anything is copied: names that would leave the folder or alias another, more than 4096 entries or 256 MB are refused. It is unpacked to the temporary folder and checked with `anvil check`'s own code (`cli::check_plugin`) against the game's `eu4.exe`, without writing `symbols.lock`. The Manager shows the name, version, authors, `affects_gameplay`, the problems, a native-code warning and whether the loader would skip it. To install, the plugin is unpacked to `anvil/data/anvil/manager/` and swapped into `anvil/plugins/<id>`, replacing the installed copy of that id after confirmation; `anvil/data/<id>` stays. Standard plugins come only from the package;
      - "What will load" is `cli::check_game`, the code of `anvil check --game`: no child process and no `anvil.exe` of another version.
    - The window: Dear ImGui (the tag `anvil-overlay` pins) on Direct3D 11 (WARP without a GPU driver), static CRT, no `imgui.ini`. Tabs for Anvil (install, repair, uninstall), Plugins (load or not through `disabled_plugins`, `allow_ironman`/`allow_multiplayer` for plugins that offer opt-in, remove, install from a zip by picker or drop), Settings (the plugin's `settings.toml` against `anvil/data/<id>/settings.toml`), Crashes, Log and About. "Play EU4" opens `steam://rungameid/236850`.
    - It runs `asInvoker`. When Windows refuses access, it offers to start again as administrator with `--game <folder>`. It imports DLLs from System32 only (`/DEPENDENTLOADFLAG:0x800`, `SetDefaultDllDirectories`), so it never loads Anvil's `version.dll` from the game folder it runs in.
    - While an `eu4.exe` of that folder runs (or one whose path cannot be read), nothing that changes the folder is offered; it checks every 1.5 s.
    - Its own settings (the game folder, the release check) are in `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Anvil\manager.toml`. The release check asks `api.github.com` for the latest release once per start, only after the player opts in, and opens only links to this repository's releases. The exe is not signed, so Windows SmartScreen may warn on the first start.

## 16. Tooling for authors

- **`anvil.exe`** (in the SDK archive) is built from the core's own library:
  - `anvil gen [--lang c|cpp|rust]`;
  - `anvil check` with strict schemas (`plugin.toml`, `symbols.toml`, `settings.toml`) and the names `anvil gen` refuses in any language it writes (the generators' own checks, so a name that cannot be generated is reported at its line before the build), which also verifies, with `--exe`, the build, bytes, memory, pointers, exports, values and instruction boundaries; with `--game <folder>`, every installed plugin and the conflicts between them;
  - `--format text|json|github`; exit codes 0 OK, 1 problems, 2 cannot check.
- **`anvil gen [--lang c|cpp|rust] <symbols.toml> <out-dir>`** writes both headers without `--lang` (`--lang rust` writes only `symbols.gen.rs`, and `settings.gen.rs` for a settings file, §9) and leaves a file alone when its content would not change:
  - `symbols.gen.h`: `SYM_<NAME>` ids, `sym_<name>_fn` pointer types from `signature`, `SYMVAL_<SYMBOL>_<VALUE>` constants;
  - `symbols.gen.hpp`: namespace `sym` with a constant per symbol whose type `sym::Types::<name>` derives from `anvil::Function<signature>`, `Site`, `Slot` or `Data<type>` ([`anvil_symbols.hpp`](../include/anvil/anvil_symbols.hpp)) and holds `symbol_name`, values as `static constexpr` members (`sym::root_and_date.date_offset`), and an `anvil::Data<type>` for each typed `rip_relative` value (`sym::root`);
  - a value is the integer in the declared bytes, or for `rip_relative` an RVA, which gen cannot know for an `export` symbol. The plugin declares the types named in `signature` and `type` before including the header. Names the C++ header cannot hold (keywords, a value called `id`, `value` or `symbol_name`, two `sym::` names alike) are errors.
- **`anvil gen [--lang c|cpp|rust] [--settings <file>] <settings.toml> <out-dir>`** does the same for settings; one call may take `symbols.toml` and `settings.toml` together. A file is a settings file when `--settings` names it, its name ends in `settings.toml` or it has `[setting.<name>]` tables. Nothing is written when an input fails.
  - `settings.gen.h`: `CFG_<NAME>` ids with the type, default, limits and label in a comment, `CFG_<NAME>_<OPTION>` indices of enum options, and with a key setting `ANVIL_KEY_SHIFT`/`CTRL`/`ALT` and `ANVIL_KEY_VK(code)`;
  - `settings.gen.rs`: the same ids and option indices as Rust constants (§9);
  - `settings.gen.hpp` (includes `anvil.hpp`): namespace `cfg` with a constant per setting whose type `cfg::Types::<name>` derives from `anvil::Setting<T>` (`get()`; T is `bool`, `std::int64_t`, `double`, `std::string`, `anvil::Key`, or for an enum the generated `enum class cfg::Types::<name>_value`) and holds `setting_name`, `restart`, `default_value`, `minimum`/`maximum` when declared, and the options as members (`cfg::mode.get() == cfg::mode.on`);
  - names the headers cannot hold are errors: C++ keywords, an option called `id`, `get`, `setting_name`, `restart`, `default_value`, `minimum` or `maximum`, a setting named like another enum's `<name>_value`, and two `CFG_` names alike.
- **Problems carry lines:** the parsers report the line of the key (one error per file, as the loader stops at it); `--exe` reports every failing symbol at its `[symbol.<name>]` line. `--format github` prints `::error file=<path>,line=<n>,title=anvil check::<message>` with the path as passed, so CI runs it from the repository root.
- **Instruction boundaries** (`--exe`): `symbols.toml` does not say how a symbol is used, so the rule covers every function or site in code with at least 5 declared bytes (a `jmp rel32`):
  - decoded from the first byte (Zydis, x86-64; `??` bytes take the image's values), the declared bytes are valid instructions and the last one ends exactly at their end, so a block replacement owns whole instructions and a hook's stolen bytes lie in verified bytes;
  - the instructions that start in the first 5 bytes, which a hook relocates, include no `JRCXZ`, `JECXZ`, `LOOP`, `LOOPE` or `LOOPNE` (§8.3);
  - a block's `resume` symbol is in code.

  Shorter sites (byte patches, which may start inside an instruction), data and pointer slots are not decoded. Hooking a symbol with fewer than 5 declared bytes would steal unverified bytes; the change registry decides whether to refuse it.
- **`anvil check --game <folder> [--format text|json|github]`** is the start-up analysis (§10) without starting the game, for a folder with `eu4.exe` and `anvil/`:
  - It reads `anvil/anvil.toml` (`enabled`, `disabled_plugins`; a file that does not parse is a problem, as the loader ignores it) and every folder of `anvil/plugins`, in the order the loader discovers them. Each plugin is checked as `anvil check <folder> --exe <folder>/eu4.exe` does, except that nothing is written: no `symbols.lock`.
  - The plugins that pass discovery (a readable `plugin.toml`, the entry DLL present) go to the loader's own resolver (`ResolveInput`, shared code in `anvil_core`): API and `anvil` range, build and symbols, duplicates, disabled ids, `conflicts`, dependencies and cycles. The result is what loads, in which order, and what is skipped and why, in the words of the loader's log. Only what the loader acts on skips a plugin: a failing instruction-boundary check is a problem of the plugin, which still loads.
  - **Overlapping ranges (warning).** `symbols.toml` does not say which symbols a plugin will change, so every verified symbol with `memory = "code"` and declared `bytes` counts as a range `[rva, rva + length)`. For each pair of plugins that load together, ranges that overlap are reported as one warning, at the symbol of the plugin that loads first (`file:line: warning: …`; `::warning` with `github`), naming both symbols, and counting further overlaps of the pair. An identical range (same address and length) is the normal case of a chain (§8.2) and is not reported. Whether two plugins really change the same bytes is decided at load by the change registry, which refuses the second change (§8.3). A warning never changes the exit code, and plugins that are skipped overlap nothing. Symbols of other memory kinds and symbols without `bytes` are not compared.
  - **Exit codes** as in `check`. 0: nothing is wrong. 1: a plugin has problems, a plugin that is not disabled by the player is skipped, or `anvil.toml` does not parse. What the player disabled (`disabled_plugins`, `enabled = false`) is listed but does not count, and neither do its problems (text and `github` print them as warnings). 2: no folder, no `eu4.exe` (or not a readable game image), no `anvil` folder, or a plugin whose files cannot be read. With 2 for the whole folder nothing else is printed.
  - **JSON** is one object, which the Manager (§15) reads. `plugins[]` has one entry per folder of `anvil/plugins`, each the result `anvil check` prints for one plugin (`result`, `exit_code`, `plugin`, `build` and `symbols` with a `symbols.toml`, `settings` (their number) with a `settings.toml`, `exe`, `problems`) plus `folder` and `status`; the other sections are always present, empty when there is nothing:
    ```json
    {
      "tool": "anvil 1.0.0",
      "result": "problems",              // "ok" | "problems" | "cannot-check"
      "exit_code": 1,
      "cannot_check": "…",               // only with "cannot-check"
      "game": {"folder": "C:/…/Europa Universalis IV",
               "exe": {"name": "eu4.exe", "sha256": "9AD3EFE1…", "build": "eu4-1.37.5-steam-win64"}},   // build: null when unknown
      "anvil_toml": {"enabled": true, "disabled_plugins": ["old-ui"]},
      "problems": [{"file": "…/anvil.toml", "line": 2, "message": "…"}],   // of anvil.toml
      "plugins": [
        {"folder": "hello", "status": "loaded",   // "loaded" | "skipped" | "disabled"
         "result": "ok", "exit_code": 0, "plugin": "hello", "build": "eu4-1.37.5-steam-win64",
         "symbols": 3, "exe": {"sha256": "…", "build": "…"}, "problems": []}
      ],
      "load_order": [{"id": "hello", "version": "0.1.0", "phase": "early", "folder": "hello"}],   // early plugins first
      "skipped": [{"id": "other", "folder": "other-1.2", "reason": "conflicts with hello 0.1.0; disable one of them", "disabled": false}],
      "warnings": [{"file": "…/hello/symbols.toml", "line": 7, "message": "…", "plugins": ["hello", "tweaks"]}]
    }
    ```
    `id` in `skipped` is the folder name when `plugin.toml` is broken; `disabled` marks what the player turned off. `file` and `line` are as in `check` (the path starts with the folder as passed; `line` 0 is the whole file). Fields may be added in minor versions; consumers ignore the ones they do not know.
  - Text prints each plugin's problems and summary, then the load order, the skipped plugins and the warnings. `github` prints annotations for the problems, for a plugin that is skipped without problems of its own, and for the warnings.
- **`symbols.lock`:** `anvil check --exe` writes the `eu4.exe` SHA-256, a digest of `symbols.toml`, the tool version and the result. CI, which cannot have the game, fails when the lock is stale.
  ```toml
  format = 1
  tool = "anvil 1.0.0"                # informational
  symbols_sha256 = "…"                # symbols.toml without a UTF-8 BOM, CRLF read as LF (git autocrlf)
  exe_sha256 = "9AD3EFE1…771A"
  build = "eu4-1.37.5-steam-win64"    # the exe's build, or "unknown"
  result = "ok"                       # or "problems"
  ```

  It lies next to `plugin.toml` and is committed. `--exe` writes it also when it finds problems, so CI fails until they are fixed, but not when a file does not parse or the exe cannot be read. Without `--exe`, a plugin with `symbols` fails on a missing lock, a different digest, `result = "problems"`, an unknown key or a newer `format`.
- **SDK:** `anvil-sdk-windows-x64.zip`, an asset of every release next to `anvil-windows-x64.zip`, in `SHA256SUMS.txt` and with the same build attestation. CI builds it with the release's own `anvil.exe` and builds the examples from it before it is published. [`sdk/`](../sdk) holds its CMake files and README.
  ```
  include/anvil/{anvil_plugin.h, anvil.hpp, anvil_symbols.hpp, anvil_game.h}
  bin/anvil.exe
  cmake/AnvilPluginConfig.cmake, AnvilPluginConfigVersion.cmake
  CMakeLists.txt  README.md  LICENSE  version.txt  third-party/  SHA256SUMS.txt
  ```
  - **Use.** A plugin repository takes the package with `FetchContent` of the release URL (the root `CMakeLists.txt` of the archive defines `anvil_add_plugin`), or with `find_package(AnvilPlugin REQUIRED)` on an unpacked archive (`-DAnvilPlugin_DIR=<sdk>/cmake`; `AnvilPluginConfigVersion.cmake` accepts a release of the same major version):
    ```cmake
    cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.25)
    project(my_plugin LANGUAGES CXX)

    include(FetchContent)
    FetchContent_Declare(anvil_sdk
        URL https://github.com/happy-dwarf-team/anvil/releases/download/v1.0.0/anvil-sdk-windows-x64.zip
        URL_HASH SHA256=<hash from the release's SHA256SUMS.txt>)
    FetchContent_MakeAvailable(anvil_sdk)

    anvil_add_plugin(my_plugin SOURCES src/plugin.cpp)
    ```
  - **`anvil_add_plugin(<target> SOURCES <files>… [PLUGIN_DIR <dir>])`** reads `plugin.toml` in the calling `CMakeLists.txt`'s folder (`PLUGIN_DIR` names another one): `id`, `entry`, `symbols`, `settings` and `api`, which must be the API the SDK builds for (2), or configuring fails. It runs `anvil gen` on `symbols.toml` at build time (`symbols.gen.h`, `symbols.gen.hpp`, plus the settings headers when `settings` is set), builds `<entry>` as a shared library with the static CRT, C++20 (C11 for C sources) and `/W4`, and lays out `<build>/plugin/<id>/{plugin.toml, symbols.toml, settings.toml?, <entry>.dll}`, one folder for every configuration. Warnings are not errors unless the repository says so (`CMAKE_COMPILE_WARNING_AS_ERROR`).
  - **`<target>-check`** runs `anvil check <plugin folder>`, and with `-DEU4_EXE=<eu4.exe>` `anvil check <plugin folder> --exe <eu4.exe>`, which also rewrites `symbols.lock` for the author to commit. **`<target>-deploy`** exists when `-DEU4_DIR=<game folder>` is set and copies the plugin folder to `<EU4_DIR>/anvil/plugins/<id>`.
  - **CI of a plugin repository:** build, `<target>-check` (the lock check) or `bin/anvil.exe check <folder> --format github`. The tree builds `examples/hello-*` through the same package, and `tests/sdk/verify-sdk.ps1` builds them from the archive both ways (`FetchContent`, `find_package`).
- **Template:** `happy-dwarf-team/anvil-plugin-template`. Its CI runs `anvil check --format github` and the lock check; its release workflow zips the plugin folder, or a mod folder for the Workshop. The README covers a first plugin in 15 minutes.

## 17. Performance budgets

Decided in [Performance budgets and how the lab measures them](https://github.com/happy-dwarf-team/anvil/issues/20).

| Quantity | Budget |
| --- | --- |
| Core start-up, no plugins (entry point → end of loading) | ≤ 20 ms; no difference in `Running application` detectable within the spread |
| Same with `anvil-game` and `anvil-overlay` | ≤ 50 ms |
| Function hook, call redirect: first / each further link | ≤ 2 ns / ≤ 2 ns |
| Mid hook, block replacement: first / each further link | ≤ 25 ns / ≤ 20 ns |
| Pointer swap, byte patch, import replacement | 0 |
| All changes of the standard plugins in a SIMULATION year | ≤ 0.5% |
| Memory: core / per change | ≤ 2 MB / ≤ 1 KB |

**Method**
- In-game impact is per-call cost × counted calls; the optional counters are enabled with `profile = true`.
- Microbenchmarks run in CI as a ±20% regression check. Binding numbers come from the lab: i9-13900KF, CPU4, median of ≥ 30.
- **Microbenchmarks** (`anvil_bench`, `bench/`; built with the project, not a ctest):
  - each case is a small function in scratch memory, changed through the change registry and called in a dependent loop. The cases are a plain call, a function hook and a call redirect with 1 and 8 links, a mid hook with 1 and 8 empty callbacks, and a block replacement next to the block's own code. The parser cases parse and resolve a typical set (10 `plugin.toml`, a 48-symbol `symbols.toml`);
  - repetitions interleave the cases; each case reports the median in ns per call;
  - a first link = 1 link − the unchanged code; each further link = (8 links − 1 link) / 7.
- **CI gate** (`bench/check-regression.ps1`):
  - Runners differ in CPU model and clock, so the gate never compares nanoseconds. It compares each case's ratio to the plain call of the same run.
  - It compares only against a baseline from the same CPU model: `bench/baseline-ci.json` keeps one entry per runner CPU.
  - Each case takes its lowest ratio of three runs. The baseline keeps the highest ratio seen on that CPU, because a short path can differ by almost 20% between two processes on the same runner (code placement). A case more than 20% slower than its baseline fails the build. A case more than 20% faster prints a notice to lower its baseline.
  - On a CPU model without an entry the gate prints the entry to add and does not fail.
  - A baseline is raised only with a reason in the pull request.
- **Lab:** `bench/run-lab.ps1` runs `anvil_bench` pinned to CPU4 at high priority, with ≥ 30 repetitions and EU4 closed, and checks the budgets above.
- **Memory** (`anvil_bench --memory`; in the lab `bench/run-lab.ps1 -Memory`, which exits 1 over a budget; CI only runs it, as the bytes depend on the Windows build):
  - The budgets count commit charge (`PrivateUsage` of `PROCESS_MEMORY_COUNTERS_EX`). The result also gives the busy heap bytes (`HeapWalk` over every process heap, without the heap's headers) and the committed private executable pages (Anvil's stubs, SafetyHook's trampolines) apart.
  - **Core:** a child process runs the real `anvil::startup()` on a game folder with the shipped `anvil.toml` and no plugins, and compares itself before the call and after the main-phase thread has ended. That covers the runtime, the change registry, the ServiceBus, the log, the settings, safe mode, the gameplay policy, the build table lookup, and crash capture with its helper thread (its committed stack; the 512 KB reservation is reported, not counted) and the DLLs it loads (`dbghelp.dll` and its dependencies, listed with their sizes; their writable pages count). The game may already have some of those DLLs loaded, so the number is an upper bound.
  - `version.dll`'s image is not private memory. Its writable sections (from its headers; mostly the crash writer's static buffers) are added to the core; its code and read-only data are file-backed and shared, so `SizeOfImage` is reported but not budgeted. This is the method of record for the core budget: start-up private bytes plus `version.dll`'s writable sections, without its image.
  - Not in the core number: what the static CRT of `version.dll` allocates before `AnvilEntry`, the transient buffers of the `eu4.exe` SHA-256 check after loading, and a thread-pool worker that loading `dbghelp.dll` sometimes starts (about 40 KB, named in `other_threads_added` when it is in the measurement).
  - **Per change:** for each kind, 1000 changes of one owner at 1000 distinct sites of a synthetic image (functions in executable scratch memory, a PE header with 1000 imports for import replacements), with a snapshot every 100 changes. Bytes per change are the slope of a least-squares line, so a stub arena or a vector's growth counts by its share. The plugin's own memory (its `next` pointers) exists before the first snapshot. Each kind reports the executable bytes per change apart; the budget is the total. Each kind runs in its own child process: in one process, heap commit one kind left behind or a commit step it ended on landed on the next kind's slope (a block replacement read about 1645 B right after the mid hooks, about 1450 B alone).
  - Mid hooks and block replacements fit the same 1 KB since 1.1 (#90). 1.0 used about 1520 B and 1540 B: each code site with them had its own executable context stub (391 B) and about 774 B and 791 B of heap in 12 blocks. Now the context stub is shared (each address adds a 24-byte thunk), a change keeps its label and symbol in one block, a dispatch list is one block, and a site keeps its few original bytes in place (heap about 638 B and 653 B in 9 blocks). About 270 B of a code site's heap is SafetyHook's own: the `InlineHook` object (168 B), its copy of the stolen bytes, and a node of its thread-trap map (96 B) that it keeps for every hooked address.
- Start-up: `anvil.log` times everything from `AnvilEntry`: `resolved … at`, `early phase done at`, and `plugins loaded at`, which is the end of the core start-up; `game ready at` follows `anvil-game.ready`.
- Start-up follows the lab procedure, with ≥ 5 runs per variant.
- SIMULATION A/B through Tongs, with ≥ 5 valid trials, guards only against ≥ 2% regressions.

Exceeding a budget blocks the release and any change to stubs, chains or core start-up.

**Call counters** (`profile = true` in `anvil/anvil.toml`, default `false`)
- Every function hook, call redirect, mid hook and block replacement requested while it is on counts its calls in its own atomic 64-bit counter, one per cache line.
- Function hooks and call redirects:
  - The chain enters the link through a 32-byte counting stub: `push rax; mov rax, counter; lock inc qword [rax]; pop rax; jmp detour`.
  - Flags are dead at a function entry and at a call, so the stub only saves `rax`.
  - The link's own `next` is unchanged.
- Mid hooks and block replacements: the shared context stub calls a counting copy of the dispatch loop, which counts each callback it calls. A callback skipped because an earlier mid hook changed `rip` is not counted.
- Off, none of this exists: chains enter detours directly and the context stub calls the plain dispatch loop. The setting is read at start-up.
- Pointer swaps, byte patches and import replacements are not counted: their cost is 0 (see the table above).
- **Report:** when the process exits, `anvil.log` gets one line per counted change under its plugin's id (at info level), e.g. `calls: function hook rva 0x8024D0 [speed_object]: 1234 calls`.
  - Removed changes that saw calls are included.
  - The report is written from `DLL_PROCESS_DETACH` and never waits for a lock: if a killed thread holds one, the report is skipped with a warning.
  - A process that is terminated (rather than exiting) writes no report.

## 18. Logging and status

`anvil/anvil.log` is UTF-8 and rotated. It records the Anvil version, the build, each plugin's status and reason, its changes, verification failures with the symbol and byte, timings and the call counters. The same status is published as the `anvil.status` service and event for the overlay and the Manager.

## 19. Security

Plugins are native code with the game's permissions:
- local plugins are trusted by placement, and Workshop plugins need per-version approval;
- Anvil and its standard plugins never download anything; the Manager's release check is opt-in and only links;
- releases are built by GitHub Actions with SHA-256 sums and provenance attestation. Code signing is fog.

## 20. Build, test, release

- CMake, with MSVC (VS 2022) as the reference toolchain. C++23 inside Anvil, a C ABI at the boundary, and the static CRT.
- **Tests:** unit tests for manifests, symbols, settings, the resolver, chains (orders, removal in any order, conflicts, staging, suspension) and the CLI, plus microbenchmarks and a Rust hello build.
- **Lab checks:** the vanilla copy, the proxy without `anvil/`, each standard plugin, the budgets, and E1/E2 for the Workshop.
- **Releases:** release-please and Conventional Commits, squash-merged PRs; the release workflow attaches the Anvil zip (`version.dll`, `anvil/` and `AnvilManager.exe`), `AnvilManager.exe` on its own, the SDK archive (with `anvil.exe`) and publishes `anvil-sys`. The three assets are in `SHA256SUMS.txt` and have a build attestation.

## 21. Open items and fog

- **Other storefront builds** ([#36](https://github.com/happy-dwarf-team/anvil/issues/36)): GOG ships two different `eu4.exe` builds (1.37.5.0 and 1.37.5.2), and the Microsoft Store exe is encrypted on disk. Unknown builds are skipped safely; GOG support needs a GOG binary (fog).
- **Workshop rules:** the Paradox forum's mod rules were not readable (E3).
- **Fog** (from the map):
  - hot reload;
  - code signing;
  - the ABI stability policy for API 2;
  - localization of player messages;
  - the shared address library;
  - a vcpkg port;
  - call counts of text hooks (lighter context);
  - OpenGL in the overlay;
  - setting profiles;
  - automatic multiplayer plugin-set exchange;
  - the safe Rust crate.

## 22. Delivery

Decided in [Rewrite or evolve, and the pull request sequence to Anvil 2](https://github.com/happy-dwarf-team/anvil/issues/28).

### 22.1 Evolve, not rewrite

- **Kept:** the proxy and entry-point hook, log, semver, resolver, services and events, build identity, CI and release-please.
- **Rewritten:** the change layer (`PatchRegistry` → a change registry with chains) and the public header.
- **Replaced:** `[[expect]]`, by `symbols.toml` verification.

### 22.2 Versions, repositories, releases

- **Versions:** the first release with plugin API 2 is **Anvil 1.0.0**. The Anvil version and the plugin API version are separate numbers.
- **Repositories:** `plugins/anvil-game`, `plugins/anvil-overlay` and `tools/manager` live in this repository (one CI, one release archive). `anvil-plugin-template`, Bellows and Tongs have their own repositories.
- **Releases:**
  - **1.0:** core with API 2, `anvil.exe`, SDK, template, `anvil-game`, settings, crash capture with safe mode, `anvil-sys`, and the migrated Bellows and Tongs.
  - **1.1:** `anvil-overlay` with the settings panel.
  - **1.2:** the Manager.
  - **1.3:** Workshop discovery and trust.
- **API 1:** no compatibility layer. Anvil 1.0 skips `api = 1` plugins with "plugin API 1: update the plugin". Bellows and Tongs migrate before 1.0 and release with it.

### 22.3 Pull-request sequence

One PR per line, Conventional Commits, squash-merged. Implementation issues and milestones track them.

**1.0**

  1. Split the core into a library shared by the loader and a CLI target.
  2. Manifest v2.
  3. `symbols.toml` parsing and verification.
  4. `anvil.exe gen` and `check` (`symbols.lock`, `--format json|github`).
- **B. Changes** (after A)
  5. Change registry with chains, staging and handles: function hook, call redirect, byte patch, import replacement, `*_at`.
  6. Mid hooks and block replacement.
  7. Pointer swap.
  8. Suspend and resume of a plugin's changes.
  9. The API 2 header, the C++ wrapper, and hello examples in C and C++.
  10. Microbenchmarks with a CI regression gate.
- **C. Around the plugins** (after B; independent of each other)
  11. Settings.
  12. Crash capture and attribution with safe mode.
  13. `conflicts` in the resolver.
  14. `anvil check --game`.

  16. SDK archive and CMake package.
- **D**
  17. `plugins/anvil-game` with the gameplay policy.
  18. `anvil-sys` with `anvil gen --lang rust`.
- **E. Elsewhere:** the `anvil-plugin-template` repository; the Bellows migration; the Tongs migration.
- **F:** lab measurements against §17, then the release-please PR.

**1.1:** `plugins/anvil-overlay`. **1.2:** `tools/manager`. **1.3:** Workshop discovery, `trust.toml`, approved copies, and the approval UI in the overlay and the Manager.
